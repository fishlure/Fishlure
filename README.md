read my carrd pony town idiots, i finally made one goddamn

https://fishlures.carrd.co/

if you are too fucking lazy to open another tab (or ur mobile which. why did u press on my github anyways.)

i go by lure/ampora/hollow for names,
he/him for pronouns (i have neos but open my carrd for that fucker)

some pt only info:
- it's rly funny to me i used to be technically docks famous lmao, I'm always up to talk about stuff most of the time
- i don't come here as often as before, if i am here probs cause im bored or with friends
- if you are pfp you can fuck yourself my man, you would laugh at this but genuinely fuck you (pfp is a name)
- i often clear my friendlist just cause its suddenly full of offline people/people i do not care/interact anymore, i'm already comfortable with the amount of friends i have outside of here, people here are only considered my mutuals, we just have to have that click yknow, so dont take it personal if i removed u or dont seem interested talking to you anymore. maybe you just weirded me out or your energy is way too different to mine and i masked that too well lol. I might have a problem!
- no i am not the species lure from creatures of sonaria please stop asking this (/j its really funny BUT IM NOT FROM ROBLOX)
- if you've heard some drama about me please let me know, not only i am curious but thats funny as shit because holy fuck this is just a web browser pony game
