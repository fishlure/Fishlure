This github profile is for ponytown, unfortunately. 

I'm Lure.
I also go by Blitz and Hollow, appreciated if you call me that.

I use he/him and also drak/drakself, try to not use they/them on me, and if you use she/her on me I will decimate you on sight (it's on fucking sight).

Usually on ponytown dockss 24/7 for some reason, I like it there.
I like talking to people, if you dont make me uncomfortable you're good in my book.

Currently very obsessed with Pokemon: Legends of Arceus (or Pokemon in general), but heres some of my interests I would love to talk about:
- Hollow Knight
- Lisa the Painful & Lisa the Joyful (Lisa RPG)
- Land of the Lustrous/Houseki No Kuni
- Rain World
- Monster Prom
- Underworld Office

Have this picture of Bunger from hit psychological horror game, Bugsnax.
